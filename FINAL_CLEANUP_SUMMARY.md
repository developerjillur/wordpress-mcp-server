## Project Status

The WordPress MCP Server is now complete and ready for use. The codebase has been cleaned up, with unnecessary analysis files removed and the test script updated to work properly with the enhanced server implementation.

The server features:
- Automatic WordPress configuration detection
- Support for different WordPress folder structures
- Local by Flywheel socket detection
- Rich WordPress database schema knowledge
- Easy deployment to any WordPress project

## Next Steps

Anyone using this project can:
1. Deploy to a WordPress project using `./deploy.sh /path/to/wordpress`
2. Run `node test.js` to verify functionality
3. Configure VS Code to use the MCP server with the Model Context Protocol extension
4. Allow AI assistants to intelligently work with WordPress database content
